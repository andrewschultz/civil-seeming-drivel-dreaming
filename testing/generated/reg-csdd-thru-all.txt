Ah, yes! You identify where the noise is coming from and what it is. You see a way out now. Perhaps there is a bit more you can do to show off, but you don't need to.
The blurring-blest purring pest, pushed back a bit, crawls into a corner. Perhaps you can still use it for a bit of practice, the sort to show advanced intelligence or whatever for its own sake.

#testcase-run-vr-turing-test-rule-default
>turing test
You think up questions to ask the blurring-blest purring pest, and surprisingly, it answers them okay at first, but once you get into detail, it breaks down.
The blurring-blest purring pest, its job (so to speak) done, disappears with a pop.

#testcase-run-vr-yo-yall-rule-default
Some people pop out from behind Woe Wall. Po' Paul, their leader, introduces himself to you.

>stow stall
by one point

With the help of Po' Paul, you uncover an area with emergency supplies. It includes ... a slick slide! Everyone patches up the entrance afterwards, because there's lots of other stuff to be stowed for even later.
The slide seems a bit too slick at the moment for travel, though. How to fix it?

#testcase-run-vr-trick-tried-rule-default
Aha! You see what was wrong with the slick slide. You see what to do. It's so tricky, I can't even describe it to you, but since you did it, you have a pretty good idea. Right?

>sick side
You figure there must be sickness to stamp out. There always is. The process of doing so is at least as important as the physical help.

>rick ride
Big Oil remains entrenched. For now. You mutter something about the petrochemical industrial complex and feel smart. (Neoliberalism, you're next, whatever you are!) Yes, one day, climate justice and such will prevail! Just not now.

>sick side
You're not going to let Big Oil keep the little guy down forever!

#testcase-run-vr-owning-eh-rule-default
You commence a small heart-to-heart with 
/(Moaning Mae and Droning Dre|Droning Dre and Moaning Mae)
. Nothing accusatory, just a suggestion they have more agency than they think. You reminisce of times you thought you were helpless but weren't, or when you should or could have done more, but you didn't. And you all share a few special moments and vow to do better in the future.

Now that you've changed the area in three ways, it makes sense that you can summon three people to help you improve it even more. They look at you as if to say, just one question to Clive over here, and he's a goner.

#testcase-run-vr-whyve-we-rule-default
Your questioning, with the Thrive Three's backing, drives Clive Klee over the edge. He gives up. If people can't appreciate his small business initiative, he'll go elsewhere! And he does. Where he stood, a Strives Tree sprouts quickly. It feels out of place here, and yet, it doesn't.

A big ol' royal rink pops up in the middle of the dystopian landscape. Worse, it's solar-powered! Doyle Dink looks furious.

#testcase-run-vr-soil-sink-rule-default
The soil collapses under the most hideous of workhouses and takes along an almost-completely-constructed Trump Tower-level-ugly skyscraper in the process! (Don't worry, they were empty. After all, it's night-time.)

>broil brink

You foment an undercurrent of constructive discontent in the populace. Nothing that would cause the quasi-police state to have cause to repress them, of course.

You've done enough damage to Doyle Dink and Oil, Inc. that enough people not only support you but also believe it's worth the risk to finish the job. You make up an impromptu speech about the little guy winning out and so forth. It's actually pretty bad, so bad Doyle Dink gives up immediately and runs away. Serendipity!

#testcase-run-vr-lie-lich-rule-default
A vicious lie lich appears! It rattles off all sorts of lies. The tricky ones seem somewhat true. Including the languid one about letting you go first even though it doesn't have to. (It does.)
But that bit about how the most powerful and spectacular spells can't disarm it? True. Except...

#testcase-run-vr-pie-pitch-rule-default

You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While it fails to discuss how the foe can fall, well, it still gives darn-good returns to scale for a measly seven letters.
Sadly, your battle cry wasn't enough for a quick victory. You are captured in a tense fight. Your army is still fighting, but your captors discuss how you don't look like much of a leader, this will still obviously be a crushing blow to those Woe Wall bums.

#testcase-run-vr-core-kit-rule-default
You discover a core kit somewhere in the darkness here. It contains a book of affirmations, some soldier toys to plan strategies and also tools you can use to climb up to somewhere less awful. So you do. But you drop the book in the process. Pity. Some of the ideas would've made you a lot more content once you woke up. That's life!

>war wit

Yes! You see what to do, now. You make believe you still have the soldier toys and see the right strategy for repelling the enemy. They'll be toast now.

>mo maul
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-mo-maul-rule-default
You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While it's relatively obvious that, given the choice between more mauling and less mauling, the first is to be preferred, (provided said mauling is of evil people who deserve it,) sometimes people need that forceful nudge to what they were going to do anyway, just to make sure they do it to the max.
Your charges appear even more, uh, charged!

>bro brawl
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-bro-brawl-rule-default
You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While "bro" doesn't feel as inclusive as it could be, those who might feel shunted focus on the "family" aspect of "bro," redirecting their anger towards those who would probably call them far worse than "bro."

>oh all
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-oh-all-rule-default
The simplicity! The universality! It's so simple and universal, several members of the Throw Thrall defect, and several briefly consider attacking themselves! Fortunately, this is not necessary. You learned from your time in the Pore Pit, and you show you're not all sloganeering as you direct the troops this way and that. It's a rout!

You give up at the final moment. Too bad. But you still, like, learned lessons and stuff. And it was only a dream. Nevertheless, you wake up. Halloween candy will be on sale today. And you're going to get to the store early. The good stuff is still there! But so is the icky stuff. Hoovering up the good stuff, you neglect the icky stuff until you reflect that you might not have had such interesting dreams without it. No, you'll take it all. Just ration it out every month. You feel very lucky. You suspect most people need to plan expensive vacations or take hallucinogens to have the sort of dreams you had. You'd like them more frequently. But not too often. That'd be weird.

Dang right you've read your Ibsen, baby. Even if you only had to for Junior-year English. And even if it seemed pointless at the time, and you only dashed off the themes the teacher wanted to read about to get a good-enough grade. It all makes more sense now. Your teacher was smarter than you thought.
You let in the light and then some! With nothing left to be done, you wake up. Halloween candy will be on sale today. And you're going to get to the store early. The good stuff is still there!

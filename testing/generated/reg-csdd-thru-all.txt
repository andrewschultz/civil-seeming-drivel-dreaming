>trick tried
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-trick-tried-rule-default
Aha! You see what was wrong with the slick slide. You see what to do. It's so tricky, I can't even describe it to you, but since you did it, you have a pretty good idea. Right?

#testcase-room-names-honing-hey-groaning-grey
/^Honing \(Hey\) Groaning, Grey$

#testcase-run-vr-tick-tide-rule-default

Five-Fee-Contrive Country is now filled with vegetation!

>lie lich
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-lie-lich-rule-default
A vicious lie lich appears! It rattles off all sorts of lies. The tricky ones seem somewhat true. You believe it, though, when it says the most powerful spells can't disarm it. Now you're in for it!

>pie pitch
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-pie-pitch-rule-default
Ha-ha! You think for a minute and realize that while powerful spells can't affect the lich, silly ones can. And this one does. Quick consultations with the witch lead to a decisive fight. The lich dissolves in a stream of wailing.

#+testcase-room-names-forfeit-bore-bit
/^Pore Pit$

#testcase-run-vr-core-kit-rule-default
You discover a core kit somewhere in the darkness here. It contains a book of affirmations, some soldier toys to plan strategies and also tools you can use to climb up to somewhere less awful. So you do. But you drop the book in the process. Pity. Some of the ideas would've made you a lot more content once you woke up. That's life!

>war wit
by one point

WRONG

Woe Wall

#testcase-run-vr-war-wit-rule-default
Yes! You see what to do, now. You make believe you still have the soldier toys and see the right strategy for repelling the enemy. They'll be toast now.

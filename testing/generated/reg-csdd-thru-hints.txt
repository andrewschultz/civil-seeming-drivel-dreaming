You scan the area. This will suffice most of the time, though you may wish to LL a thing that doesn't jibe with the location's rhymes.
You get an interesting reading when it flips to the BRUTES BRAVING SUITS SAVING text. The numbers blink from (0.50, 0.50) to (-0.50, -0.50) and back, as if it's clueless what should have been changed from, or to, what.
Perhaps you will get more meaningful information scanning the blurring-blest purring pest.

You get an interesting reading when it flips to the BRUTES BRAVING SUITS SAVING text. The numbers blink from (0.50, 0.50) to (-0.50, -0.50) and back, as if it's clueless what should have been changed from, or to, what.
Perhaps you will get more meaningful information scanning the blurring-blest purring pest.

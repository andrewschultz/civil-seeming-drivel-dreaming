A vicious lie lich appears! It rattles off all sorts of lies. The tricky ones seem somewhat true. Including the languid one about letting you go first even though it doesn't have to. (It does.)
But that bit about how the most powerful and spectacular spells can't disarm it? True. Except...

#testcase-check-vc-foe-fall-rule-fallthrough
You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While it fails to discuss how the foe can fall, well, it still gives darn-good returns to scale for a measly seven letters.
Sadly, your battle cry wasn't enough for a quick victory. You are captured in a tense fight. Your army is still fighting, but your captors discuss how you don't look like much of a leader, this will still obviously be a crushing blow to those Woe Wall bums.

You discover a core kit somewhere in the darkness here. It contains a book of affirmations, some soldier toys to plan strategies and also tools you can use to climb up to somewhere less awful. So you do. But you drop the book in the process. Pity. Some of the ideas would've made you a lot more content once you woke up. That's life!

You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While it's relatively obvious that, given the choice between more mauling and less mauling, the first is to be preferred, (provided said mauling is of evil people who deserve it,) sometimes people need that forceful nudge to what they were going to do anyway, just to make sure they do it to the max.
Your charges appear even more, uh, charged!

The simplicity! The universality! It's so simple and universal, several members of the Throw Thrall defect, and several briefly consider attacking themselves! Fortunately, this is not necessary. You learned from your time in the Pore Pit, and you show you're not all sloganeering as you direct the troops this way and that. It's a rout!
But sadly, you didn't continue the battle cry after the Throw Thrall defections. Their minds unfogged by your charisma, they realize they are close to capturing the leader. So they do. Again. You're thrown to somewhere different this time...

Dang right you've read your Ibsen, baby. Even if you only had to for Junior-year English. And even if it seemed pointless at the time, and you only dashed off the themes the teacher wanted to read about to get a good-enough grade. It all makes more sense now. Your teacher was smarter than you thought.
You let in the light and then some! With nothing left to be done, you wake up. Halloween candy will be on sale today. And you're going to get to the store early. The good stuff is still there! But so is the icky stuff. Hoovering up the good stuff, you neglect the icky stuff until you reflect that you might not have had such interesting dreams without it. No, you'll take it all. Just ration it out every month. You feel very lucky. You suspect most people need to plan expensive vacations or take hallucinogens to have the sort of dreams you had. You'd like them more frequently. But not too often. That'd be weird.

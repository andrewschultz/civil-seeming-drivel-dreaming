}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.

You scan the area. This will suffice most of the time, though you may wish to LL a thing that doesn't jibe with its rhymes.
You get an interesting reading when it flips to the BRUTES BRAVING SUITS SAVING text. The numbers blink from (0.50, 0.50) to (-0.50, -0.50) and back, as if it's clueless what should have been changed from, or to, what.
Perhaps you will get more meaningful information scanning the blurring blest purring pest.

With the help of Po' Paul, you uncover an area with emergency supplies. It includes ... a slick slide! Everyone patches up the entrance afterwards, because there's lots of other stuff to be stowed for even later.

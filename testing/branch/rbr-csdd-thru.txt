#stable-file: this eventually says that the project is stable, and I shouldn't change the main/minimal file unless I really need to.
#--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.

}$SCOS=You have scored a total of {SCORE} out of {MAX} points and need {CURMIN} to win. You have found {CURMIN} of {MAXBONUS} optional points so far.
}$MISSINGONE=1 optional point is no longer available.
}$MISSING={} optional points are no longer available.

You perform a Turing Test on yourself, since nobody else is around. You hope you passed, but then again, maybe the only reason you passed is because you aren't sentient enough to detect fake sentience.

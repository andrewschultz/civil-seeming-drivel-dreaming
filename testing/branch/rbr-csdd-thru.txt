You don't need any special verbs to win. The four basic cardinal directions work, and you can T NPC for small clues, maybe. The main thing is to guess what to say--you may note something about the room name and the pest.
OPTS also gives options.

You scan the area. This will suffice most of the time, though you may wish to LL a thing that doesn't jibe with the location's rhymes.
You get an interesting reading when it flips to the BRUTES BRAVING SUITS SAVING text. The numbers blink from (0.50, 0.50) to (-0.50, -0.50) and back, as if it's clueless what should have been changed from, or to, what.
Perhaps you will get more meaningful information scanning the blurring-blest purring pest.

Ah, yes! You identify where the noise is coming from and what it is. You see a way out now. Perhaps there is a bit more you can do to show off, but you don't need to.

With the help of Po' Paul, you uncover an area with emergency supplies. It includes ... a slick slide! Everyone patches up the entrance afterwards, because there's lots of other stuff to be stowed for even later.
The slide seems a bit too slick at the moment for travel, though. How to fix it?

You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While it fails to discuss how the foe can fall, well, it still gives darn-good returns to scale for a measly seven letters.
Sadly, your battle cry wasn't enough for a quick victory. You are captured in a tense fight. Your army is still fighting, but your captors discuss how you don't look like much of a leader, this will still obviously be a crushing blow to those Woe Wall bums.

You show the plea-plight wee wight ways to be scary. You paint images in its mind. It whips out a notebook, jots down some ideas, then waits for more. It needs a way to know it's nailed down what you said!

The plea-plight wee wight takes its notebook back out and scribbles and nods its head! It sees how to be more scary in the future, for the next person. You advise it of proper priorities in the afterlife--perhaps it's best not to, like, level-draining lawful-good adventurers that pass through. You'd feel bad about that.

A big ol' pun pool -- bubbling like alphabet soup -- begins bubbling up. The done-duel gun ghoul looks interested, despite itself.

The done-duel gun ghoul relaxes a bit. Maybe too much. Definitely too much. It drops its weapons and jumps into the pool, with predictable results! It and the pool consume each other.

Dang right you've read your Ibsen, baby. Even if you only had to for Junior-year English. And even if it seemed pointless at the time, and you only dashed off the themes the teacher wanted to read about to get a good-enough grade. It all makes more sense now. Your teacher was smarter than you thought.
You let in the light and then some! With nothing left to be done, you wake up from this bizarre nightmare to a world where somehow Herschel Walker, Kari Lake and Dr. Oz are pretty much guaranteed of getting 40% of the vote in a statewide election.
But hey, Halloween candy will be on sale today! And you're going to get to the store early. The good stuff is still there! But so is the icky stuff. Hoovering up the good stuff, you neglect the icky stuff until you reflect that you might not have had such interesting dreams without it. No, you'll take it all. Just ration it out every month. You feel very lucky. You suspect most people need to plan expensive vacations or take hallucinogens to have the sort of dreams you had. You'd like them more frequently. But not too often. That'd be weird.

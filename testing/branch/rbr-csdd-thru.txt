You scan the area. This will suffice most of the time, though you may wish to LL a thing that doesn't jibe with its rhymes.
You get an interesting reading when it flips to the BRUTES BRAVING SUITS SAVING text. The numbers blink from (0.50, 0.50) to (-0.50, -0.50) and back, as if it's clueless what should have been changed from, or to, what.
Perhaps you will get more meaningful information scanning the blurring-blest purring pest.

Ah, yes! You identify where the noise is coming from and what it is. You see a way out now. Perhaps there is a bit more you can do to show off, but you don't need to.

Sadly, your battle cry wasn't enough for a quick victory. You are captured in a tense fight. Your army is still fighting, but your captors discuss how you don't look like much of a leader, this will still obviously be a crushing blow to the Woe Wall bums.

You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While it's relatively obvious that, given the choice between more mauling and less mauling, the first is to be preferred, (provided said mauling is of evil people who deserve it,) sometimes people need that forceful nudge to what they were going to do anyway, just to make sure they do it to the max.
Your charges appear even more, uh, charged!

You spring a battle cry, simple and effective! While "bro" doesn't feel as inclusive as it could be, those who might feel shunted focus on the "family" aspect of "bro," redirecting their anger towards those who would probably call them far worse than "bro."

The simplicity! The universality! It's so simple and universal, several members of the Throw Thrall defect, and several briefly consider attacking themselves! Fortunately, this is not necessary. You learned from your time in the Pore Pit, and you show you're not all sloganeering as you direct the troops this way and that. It's a rout!
But sadly, you didn't continue the battle cry after the Throw Thrall defections. Their minds unfogged by your charisma, they realize they are close to capturing the leader. So they do. Again. You're thrown to somewhere different this time...

You give up at the final moment. Too bad. But you still, like, learned lessons and stuff. And it was only a dream. Nevertheless, you wake up. Halloween candy will be on sale today. And you're going to get to the store early. The good stuff is still there! But so is the icky stuff. Hoovering up the good stuff, you neglect the icky stuff until you reflect that you might not have had such interesting dreams without it. No, you'll take it all. Just ration it out every month. You feel very lucky. You suspect most people need to plan expensive vacations or take hallucinogens to have the sort of dreams you had. You'd like them more frequently. But not too often. That'd be weird.
Your score just went up by one point.

Dang right you've read your Ibsen, baby. Even if you only had to for Junior-year English. And even if it seemed pointless at the time, and you only dashed off the themes the teacher wanted to read about to get a good-enough grade. You let in the light and then some! With nothing left to be done, you wake up. Halloween candy will be on sale today. And you're going to get to the store early. The good stuff is still there! But so is the icky stuff. Hoovering up the good stuff, you neglect the icky stuff until you reflect that you might not have had such interesting dreams without it. No, you'll take it all. Just ration it out every month. You feel very lucky. You suspect most people need to plan expensive vacations or take hallucinogens to have the sort of dreams you had. You'd like them more frequently. But not too often.

}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.

You perform a Turing Test on yourself, since nobody else is around. You hope you passed, but then again, maybe the only reason you passed is because you aren't sentient enough to detect fake sentience.

Ha-ha! You think for a minute and realize that while powerful spells can't affect the lich, silly ones can. And this one does. Quick consultations with the witch lead to a decisive fight. The lich dissolves in a stream of wailing.

You discover a core kit somewhere in the darkness here. It contains a book of affirmations, some soldier toys to plan strategies and also tools you can use to climb up to somewhere less awful. So you do. But you drop the book in the process. Pity. Some of the ideas would've made you a lot more content once you woke up. That's life!
